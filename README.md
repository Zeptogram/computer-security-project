## Introduction

BlueKeep vulnerability, identified in May 2019 as CVE-2019-0708, is a serious security flaw found in systems prior to Windows 8 that use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It was rated with the maximum severity "Critical", the highest level by the Microsoft Security Response Center and has a CVSS v3.x score of 9.8.

This vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) without authentication, making it extremely dangerous; notably, it can behave similarly to WannaCry, replicating and spreading to other machines (i.e., it is “wormable”).

In this paper, the vulnerability’s mechanism, the tools and environments used for the experiment, and the results obtained from its practical verification will be analyzed.
